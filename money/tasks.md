## TODO: Withdraw from Samuel's Vanguard Education Account

- Samuel has a Vanguard 529 account (~$33.6K balance)
- Samuel is currently at UNT (paying tuition/fees already — see College category)
- Need to figure out the proper withdrawal process — tax implications, qualified expenses, etc.
- Goal: withdraw to reimburse college costs already being paid out of pocket
- Research: what counts as qualified expenses (tuition, room/board, books, etc.), penalties for non-qualified, how to initiate withdrawal from Vanguard
