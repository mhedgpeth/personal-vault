## Goals

Top three goals right now:

- [ ] Practice with moises so my acoustic guitar and vocals are solid.
- [ ] Book shows
- [ ] Work through art direction and setlist that fits with everyone

## Practice

**Goal**: I'm the weak link for the instruments, I need to practice with moises regularly to get clear on things.

**Problems:**

- The acoustic doesn't come through well enough in Moises because these songs are so electric-driven, so I'm not sure I'm doing it right
- I need to be regular
- It's not clear which songs I'm singing/playing

## Bookings

**Goal:** gig two times a month, minimum of $200 each gig. Regularly playing.

### Growth Plan

1. **Crawl: $200-$800/gig** — Breweries, bars, open mics. Goal: consistency and polish.
2. **Walk: $800-$2,500/gig** — City concerts, mid-size venues, some corporate/weddings. Need EPK here.
3. **Run: $2,500-$6,000/gig** — Festivals, larger venues, corporate/wedding/private.

- [x] Discover minimum for people getting paid ($200 total, $100 each to Will and Elliott, everyone else is willing to play for free right now)
- [ ] Contact Outback Saloon

## Electronic Press Kit (EPK)

**Goal:** Create an EPK so we can professionally pitch to venues that require one.

An EPK typically includes:

- Band bio / story
- Photos (promo shots, live performance)
- Music samples or video clips
- Song list / set list
- Contact info
- Press quotes or testimonials (if available)

**Status:** Not started.

- [ ] Decide on format (website page, PDF, or both)
- [ ] Write band bio
- [ ] Gather/take promo photos
- [ ] Record demo audio or video clips
- [ ] Assemble and publish EPK

## Art Direction

**Goal:** songs selected, practiced that will fit the band together in a single artistic outcome, that gets us bookings.

Annie and Michael have been married for 25 years.
Marti and Cheyenne have been married for 15 years.

**Problems:**

1. Annie feels left out, she doesn't sing until 45 minutes in, her Adelle-like voice in the keys she wants doesn't get premiered enough.
2. Marti doesn't have direction, ends up using her drama background to go off script and be funny, it annoys Annie.
3. Cheyenne was the frontrunner of his 1980s cover band, but that was a higher vocal register and this isn't.
4. Annie and Michael want the vibe of: come for the dancing, good wholesome time. Cheynene and Marti want: come for a good time, we're going to be the biggest fools of them all to get you to loosen up. These things aren't aligned.
