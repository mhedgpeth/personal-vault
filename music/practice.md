# Practice

[Moises](https://moises.ai) Pro Subscription until January 2027 with <michael@hedge-ops.com> login.

Using iPad if needed, or [full setup](./equipment.md) if needed.

## Problems

- Being regular with this, and systematic.

## Getting Songs into Moises

Goal: High fidelity (FLAC/lossless) source files for best stem separation in Moises.

### Setup (~$25-30 one-time, ~$10/yr ongoing)

1. **Usenet block account:** [Usenet.Farm](https://usenet.farm) — 500GB for ~$17, never expires. Cheapest per-GB option.
2. **NZB indexer:** [NZBGeek](https://nzbgeek.info) — $12/yr. No invite needed, good Lidarr integration, active community.
3. **Docker Compose** with [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio) + [SABnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org) on Mac. Config stored in iCloud for backup. Compose file lives outside this repo.
4. **Import** downloaded FLAC files into Moises. Use Hi-Fi stem separation (included with Pro).

### Workflow

1. Add artist/album in Lidarr, set quality profile to FLAC
2. Lidarr searches indexer, sends download to SABnzbd
3. SABnzbd downloads and Lidarr organizes into music library
4. Import from music library into Moises
