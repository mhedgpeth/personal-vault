## Problems

- [ ] Sound quality, especially with electric driven songs that have a light acoustic. Ben recommended I look at [Lidarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/)
- [ ] Song selection, especially given the art direction problems we're having.
- Being regular with this, and systematic.

## Songs

- Friends in Low Places (Michael)
- Strawberry Wine (Annie)
- Be My Baby Tonight (Michael vocals?)
