# Music

I am in a 90's cover country band called Friends in High Places.

The key goals for this directory are:

- practice: keeping track of my own practice for songs
- booking: getting bookings for shows

## Structure

- `overview`: where we are and the next steps (start here)
- `sets`: for the songs we are doing with sets
- `gigs`: what's planned, what we have done, and how much we got paid
- `people`: the artists in the band
- `equipment`: the equipment we use
